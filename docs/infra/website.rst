Managing the website
====================

This article explains how the website is managed and how to submit changes or
improvements.


Pre-requirements

To work with the website, you will need a few things.

.. _`git`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git


Description
-----------

The `website source code`_ is hosted on GitHub under the `RITcraft
organization`_. The website is mostly static information with some PHP added to
retrieve the status of a Minecraft server and for some other minor features.

Since the website is open source (under the `Apache License 2.0`_), new
contributions are accepted as pull requests in the `GitHub repository`_. Any
changes to the website should always be submitted as pull requests. Peer review
is encouraged, especially if the RITcraft executive board has five or more
members.

For help updating the website, please contact a system administrator (find a
directory here: :doc:`../roles/sysadmin`).
