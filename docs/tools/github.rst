RITcraft GitHub organization
============================

The `RITcraft GitHub organization <https://github.com/RITcraft>`_ is where all
the open source plugins, tools, and website source code live. This article
explains how it's used and how to be added to it.


Description
-----------

If you are a member of the executive board and plan to make technical
contributions to the server, such as Java plugin development or web design and
development, you will need to be a member of the RITcraft GitHub organization.
All of the projects RITcraft community and staff members have created are found
here.

Any technical projects created for the server should be made available as a new
repository on GitHub. Open sourcing our projects makes it easier for others in
the community to contribute and also makes it easier for others to inherit the
server in the future.


Current projects
----------------

For convenience, a current list of the projects hosted on GitHub is below.

- `admin-handbook`_: This handbook you are reading now

How to join
-----------

Executive board members who plan to make technical contributions should be
members of the RITcraft GitHub organization. Currently, there are three teams
that members can be assigned to.

- **Plugin Developers**: Working on the SpigotMC Minecraft plugins for in-game

- **System Administrators**: Maintaining the infrastructure / server for
  RITcraft

- **Web Design**: Working on the RITcraft website

Anyone can belong to one or more of these teams. Note that adding someone to a
new team grants them write access to some of the repositories.

To be added to the GitHub organization, please contact the president or a
system administrator for help (see :doc:`../roles/president` and
:doc:`../roles/sysadmin` for more info).
