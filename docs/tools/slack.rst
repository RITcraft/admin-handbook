Using Slack
===========

.. note:: Slack is what is currently used now. In the future, RITcraft may move
   to the EGS Discord server, to better connect us with the other EGS
   communities. Be aware this may change in the future.

Slack is a team communication tool that lets an organization or team split
conversations across different, topic-based channels. RITcraft has its own
Slack for members and executive board members to communicate.


Description
-----------

The RITcraft Slack is where all RITcraft players and members go to talk with
other community members. Additionally, players are awarded with extra
privileges on the server by joining the Slack. This encourages participation
and involvement with the community outside of the game.

Different channels cover a range of topics. As a member of the executive board,
a regular presence on Slack is expected (e.g. taking no longer than 24 hours to
respond to a direct message). Active participation is vital to successful
communication among the executive board.


Joining Slack
-------------

`ritcraft.slack.com <https://ritcraft.slack.com>`_

Anyone can join the Slack with a valid RIT email address (``@rit.edu``). Find
instructions to sign up `here <https://ritcraft.slack.com/signup/>`_.

When signing up, please use your real name and consider adding a profile
picture to your account. You are helping represent RITcraft and EGS, so try to
make yourself approachable for others in the community.

Set up notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After joining Slack, make sure you are in the ``eboard`` group to discuss with
other executive board members. Check out what channels are public and join new
ones that interest you. After, adjust your notification preferences. If you are
an executive board member, try to make yourself accessible if someone directly
mentions you.
