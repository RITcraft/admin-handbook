Google Drive
============

Occasionally, Google Drive is used as a collaboration tool among executive
board members. This article explains what content exists in our Google Drive
and how to get access.


Description
-----------

Google Drive is not often used by RITcraft, but is sometimes used to work
collaboratively on shared documents. Usually, this is for taking notes during
executive board (i.e. "Eboard") meetings. It's also sometimes used for working
with members of EGS, such as for planning LANs.

Generally, use of Google Drive should be avoided since it is not regularly used
(raising the chances of things getting lost over time). However, when it makes
sense, like for meeting notes, it should be used.


How to get access
-----------------

The president of the RITcraft Eboard should have ownership of the folder. The
ownership privileges should be passed from president to president, after every
election. Any new executive board members should be added by the president to
the folder.

Please contact the existing president for information on how to do this (for
more help, see :doc:`../roles/president`).
