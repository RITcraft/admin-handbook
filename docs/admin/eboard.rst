Executive board transitioning
=============================

This article explains some common procedures and steps to follow when old
members of the executive board (i.e. "Eboard") leave and new members are
joining the Eboard.

*Note*: Off-boarding tasks are fulfilled at the discretion of the incoming
Eboard. In RITcraft history, former Eboard members that continue to be active
members often retain access for various things.


Elections
---------

At the end of every academic year, elections should be held for the executive
board. If possible, these elections should be held in tandem with the annual
EGS elections. Community liaison(s) to EGS should help coordinate this. The
official EGS ballot and voting system should be used.

*Note*: If a seat is unfilled, elections may be held in the fall.


Update EGS records
------------------

After the election, the EGS Eboard should be notified to the changes in the
RITcraft Eboard. New Eboard members should attend the weekly EGS meetings as
Minecraft representatives. Outgoing Eboard members should help encourage and
invite the incoming Eboard members to attend the EGS Eboard meetings.

Transfer EGSRIT.com email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EGS provides an email account for the RITcraft Eboard, ``ritcraft [at] egsrit
[dot] com``. This account is usually managed by the president, but other
members of Eboard can also have access.

To migrate this account, please contact the EGS webmaster for help.


Update permissions and privileges
---------------------------------

This sections covers updating permissions and privileges for different
platforms and tools used by RITcraft.

In-game permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Outgoing Eboard members should have their privileges removed and incoming
Eboard members should be given new privileges after an election. 

Facebook group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`facebook.com/groups/egsminecraft/ <https://www.facebook.com/groups/egsminecraft/>`_

A long time ago, a `Facebook group`_ used to be the primary gathering place for
the community, but it is no longer actively used. Nonetheless, outgoing Eboard
members should have admin privileges revoked and incoming Eboard members should
be given admin privileges in the group.

GitHub organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Eboard members who wish to contribute technical skills to the server should
be added to the RITcraft GitHub organization (see :doc:`../tools/github`` for
more information).

Google Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add incoming Eboard members to the shared Google Drive folder. If a new
president is elected, ownership should be transferred to their account (for
more information, see :doc:`../tools/google-drive``).


Financial certification
-----------------------

Since EGS is a student government-sponsored club, there are special rules and
guidelines that must be followed. Since RITcraft is an official community and
is recognized by EGS as an official community, **all Eboard members must be
financially certified**, as per the RIT clubs office requirements.

Financial certification usually opens at the beginning of every semester.
Contact the EGS treasurer with questions about financial certification.
